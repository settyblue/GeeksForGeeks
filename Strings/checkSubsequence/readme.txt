 * 
 * Given two strings str1 and str2, find if str1 is a subsequence of str2. A subsequence 
 * is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements 
 * without changing the order of the remaining elements. Expected time 
 * complexity is linear.
 * 
 * Input: str1 = "AXY", str2 = "ADXCPY"
 * Output: True (str1 is a subsequence of str2)
 * 
 * Input: str1 = "AXY", str2 = "YADXCP"
 * Output: False (str1 is not a subsequence of str2)
