 * 
 * Find the largest rectangular area possible in a given histogram 
 * where the largest rectangle can be made of a number of contiguous bars. 
 * For simplicity, assume that all bars have same width and the width is 1 unit.
 * 
 * For example, consider the following histogram with 7 bars of heights {6, 2, 5, 4, 5, 2, 6}. 
 * The largest possible rectangle possible is 12.
