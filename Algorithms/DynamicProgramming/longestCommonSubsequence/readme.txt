 * 
 * Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in 
 * both of them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same 
 * relative order, but not necessarily contiguous. For example, “abc”, 
 * “abg”, “bdf”, “aeg”, ‘”acefg”, .. etc are subsequences of “abcdefg”. 
 * So a string of length n has 2^n different possible subsequences.
