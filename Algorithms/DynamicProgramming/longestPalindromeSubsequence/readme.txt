 * Given a sequence, find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in it. 
 * For example, if the given sequence is “BBABCBCAB”, then the output should be 7 as “BABCBAB” 
 * is the longest palindromic subseuqnce in it. “BBBBB” and “BBCBB” are also palindromic subsequences 
 * of the given sequence, but not the longest ones.
