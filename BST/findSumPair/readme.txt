 * 
 * Given a Balanced Binary Search Tree and a target sum, write a function 
 * that returns true if there is a pair with sum equals to target sum, 
 * otherwise return false. Expected time complexity is O(n) and only O(Logn) 
 * extra space can be used. Any modification to Binary Search Tree is not allowed. 
 * Note that height of a Balanced BST is always O(Logn).
