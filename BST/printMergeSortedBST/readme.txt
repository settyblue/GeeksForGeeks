 * Given two Binary Search Trees(BST), print the elements of both BSTs in sorted form. 
 * The expected time complexity is O(m+n) where m is the number of nodes in first tree 
 * and n is the number of nodes in second tree. 
 * Maximum allowed auxiliary space is O(height of the first tree + height of the second tree).

=========
Good logic.
