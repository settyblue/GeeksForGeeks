 * Given an unsorted array of positive integers. 
 * Find the number of triangles that can be formed with 
 * three different array elements as three sides of triangles. 
 * For a triangle to be possible from 3 values, the sum of any two values (or sides) 
 * must be greater than the third value (or third side).
